            <h3>Profile</h3>
            <p>I am Aisheeya Lizabhelle L. Cariaga, a 19-year-old first-year Computer Science 
                student at Laguna State Polytechnic University. I have a strong passion for both 
                technology and creativity, which allows me to approach projects with a balance of 
                logic and artistic expression. I enjoy exploring how design and functionality work
                 together to create meaningful digital experiences. As a student, I am committed 
                 to continuous learning and self-improvement, especially in the fields of 
                 programming and digital design. I value discipline, focus, and consistency in 
                 both my academic and creative work. I am motivated by challenges that push me to 
                 think critically and creatively. Through my projects, I aim to build solutions 
                 that are not only functional but also visually intentional.</p>

            <div class = "int">
                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>I have a strong interest in digital design, particularly creating clean, visually 
                    appealing layouts with a clear purpose. I enjoy writing, as it allows me to express 
                    ideas and creativity in a more reflective way. Arts and crafts also play a role in 
                    my creative process, helping me develop patience and attention to detail. Alongside 
                    creative interests, I am passionate about coding and learning how systems and 
                    applications are built. I enjoy exploring the intersection of design and technology. 
                    In my free time, I stay active through sports, especially table tennis, which helps 
                    improve my focus and coordination. These interests reflect my balanced approach to 
                    creativity, logic, and personal growth.</p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I have developed strong problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, allowing 
                    me to analyze situations and find efficient solutions. I am naturally creative, 
                    which helps me generate ideas that are both innovative and visually engaging. My 
                    adaptability enables me to learn new tools and adjust quickly to different tasks 
                    and environments. I also demonstrate leadership skills, particularly in group 
                    projects and collaborative settings. I possess solid digital and computer skills, 
                    which I apply in design, programming, and academic work. I work well independently 
                    but also thrive in team-based environments. Overall, I approach tasks with focus, 
                    responsibility, and attention to detail.

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    I have nearly two years of experience working as a Canva graphic designer, 
                    where I design wedding invitations and website layouts as a side gig. This 
                    experience has strengthened my creativity, time management, and ability to 
                    meet client expectations. I have worked on various design styles, allowing me 
                    to adapt to different themes and preferences. I am also a graphic committee 
                    member of the Organization for Computing and Technology Advancement (OCTA) at 
                    Laguna State Polytechnic University. In this role, I contribute to visual 
                    materials for events, announcements, and organizational branding. Additionally, 
                    I have completed multiple school-based design projects that required 
                    collaboration and technical understanding. These experiences have helped me 
                    build confidence in both my creative and technical abilities.
